Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Michael Richardson and I'm a software developer and developer community organizer.

I'm the Tech Lead for Kroger Digital's SEO team. As part of my job I'm privileged to mentor some great junior developers and provide leadership in the Kroger Customer Experience org.

I organize a variety of developer community events in the Cincinnati area. The most prominent are:

[Momentum Developer Conference](https://momentumdevcon.com)

[Cincinnati Software Craftsmanship](https://www.meetup.com/Cincinnati-Software-Craftsmanship/)
